DoD - issues completed and tested, with no errors or bugs, and with no problems in the connection between modules. Work with no problems or in need of alterations.
DoR - issues partially completed, with some errors or bugs, and with some problems in the connection between modules. Work with some problems or in need of alterations.

## Retrospective
- This Sprint was a bit more difficult than the previous one, since we had to implement more complex issues. 
- This lead to some issues not being completed, and some of them not being tested. 
- This was due to poor time management, and the fact that we didn't fully understand how to implement some issues, for example ALGAV related - lots of problems due to no information on how to actually connect the different modules to use PROLOG predicates.
- For the SGRAI component, poor time management and lack of knowledge and orientation lead to some problems on issue 603.
- The implementation of our frontend module, to create the pages for each issue and role is the one we are more secure about, since the implementation was easier and done in the beginning of the sprint.
-  ASIST component's issues were also completed with more ease, since the implementations was easier and the creation of the documentation was simpler.
- Overall we can point out a lot of problems and issues and could be better, but we are already thinking of ways to improve them and make the last sprint better than this one.
- SGRAI and ALGAV are the worst components.
- The communication between components needs improvement for ALGAV, since we have problems communicating with the PROLOG server.
- the team needs to figure out how to generate the burndown chart, since we are having problems with it.
- the team needs to use another tool to create the sprint backlog, as using github issues is not working for us - in order to create the burdown chart we need to use the sprint backlog, and we are having problems with it.
- the code needs more testing and the diagrams should have been done sooner to guarantee their quality.
