## Retrospective
Total de US: 98
US Done: 80

Percentagem de US concluídas: (80 / 98) * 100 ≈ 81,63%

- Pontos Positivos:

A maioria das user stories foi concluída com sucesso (79,49%).
Implementações sem problemas significativos foram relatadas em várias user stories.
Desafios Enfrentados:

Problemas de gerenciamento de tempo foram destacados, levando a atrasos em algumas user stories.
Algumas user stories estavam na fase de teste devido a questões de qualidade e falta de tempo.
Dificuldades específicas foram encontradas na user story 1120, relacionada à abordagem do formulário de mapa.

- Ações Corretivas Propostas:

Reforçar a gestão do tempo para evitar atrasos nas entregas.
Melhorar a qualidade das implementações, especialmente em casos como a user story 1120.
Focar em resolver problemas de conexão entre os módulos, especialmente nas user stories 720, 740 e 1410.

- Próximos Passos:

Concluir as user stories em andamento, especialmente as que estão na fase de teste.
